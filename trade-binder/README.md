# Trade-Binder : A front-end personal project

## A virtual replication of a real-world MTG trading card collection that can be sent to friends in order to ease trading.

As you would expect from a trading card game, trading cards with friends is a pivotal part of Magic: the Gathering.  
This project is a website that replicates a real-world trading card collection that can be sent to friends in order to ease trading.  
Cards are searched for and added using Scryfall API,  an already established API, accessed through axios.  
These cards can then be added to a pSQL database through an API I have created with express and node.js.

The front-end is a small project focusing mainly on developing my CSS skills, in particular using a CSS framework for the first time - I chose Tailwind due to the rising popularity of this library.
Tailwind  and React was used to create all of the elements you can see on the website, including organising the grid of cards and users.  I worked with the documentation of Tailwind CSS to install and use this library.  

I created my own button component, which was then adapted slightly throughout the site to create a stylised theme.  
The colour pallete is minimal and simple to continue this theme.  
Overall, I found working with Tailwind intuitive and easy, I am therefore looking to use this library further.  
My next step in this project will be to use Javascript and Tailwind to add animations to my site.
